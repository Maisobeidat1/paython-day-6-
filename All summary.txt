Ticket #701 – GPA Calculation Broken
I fixed class and method naming to follow PEP8 (CamelCase for classes, snake_case for methods).
I also updated the GPA calculation logic to handle different scales.
This makes the code cleaner, consistent, and easier to maintain.

Ticket #702 – Missing File Crash
I used a try/except block to handle missing files instead of crashing.
I also checked file existence with os.path.exists() and used with open(...).
This improves error handling and keeps the program stable.

Ticket #703 – System Fails with 1000+ Students
I replaced the list with a dictionary for faster access by student ID.
This follows PEP8 advice to use the right data structure for the problem.
The solution improves performance and keeps the code organized.

Ticket #704 – No Audit Trail
I added the logging module instead of using print.
Now all read/write operations are logged for better traceability.
This follows PEP8 practices and makes the system easier to audit.



Ticket #705 – Code is Unreadable

I refactored the code into clean OOP structure following PEP8.
I added docstrings for documentation and separated logic into functions/classes.
This makes the code readable, maintainable, and professional.
